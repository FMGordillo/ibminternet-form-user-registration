# IBM Internet Form

Since 2018 everytime that a visitor goes to an IBM building it has to create an account, and has to confirm the mail. And then use the generated password to sign in.

As an IBMer/seller/organizer I forgot to do this in advanced, mostly for the "has to confirm account" thing (_`"i want internet, i can't confirm my mail, duh."`_)

This is where this tool comes in.
